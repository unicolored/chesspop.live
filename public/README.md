# Chessfield 🍿 Live

__Chessfield__ is designed to display live games or static FEN in a spectator interactive 3D mode. Take a snack, enjoy!

I hope it will help online players like me to keep an IRL view and analysis of the chess games.
Chessfield is connected to live stream data (like [lichess.org/tv](https://lichess.org/tv)).
