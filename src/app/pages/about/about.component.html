  <h2>Why ChessPop?</h2>
  <p>
    I’m an online chess player myself, and I wanted a way to keep that real-life, over-the-board feel while watching games online. Chesspop uses a cool 3D view (powered by my <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessfield" target="_blank">Chessfield</a> package) to help you see and analyze games in a fresh, spectator-friendly way. It’s all about enjoying chess like you’re right there at the table!
